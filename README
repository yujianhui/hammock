Hammock is a Rails plugin that eliminates redundant code. String up Hammock and specify how your controllers should behave, instead of repetitively repeating the specifics of REST redundantly.

Hammock enforces and abstracts RESTful resource access from the controller in favour of a clean callback system

Lots of functionality is planned that will take this much, much furtherâ€”in particular, proper nested route support with routing table traversal, and a resource-centric scoping security model.

A short HOWTO along with a sample Rails app is on the way. Get knee-deep in the code and enjoy! :)
