Fix the loading code to achieve the same load whether hammock is installed as a plugin or a gem.
Send toplevel loading include to ActionController::Base instead of reopening ApplicationController.
Replaced escort_for_40[34] with render_for_status, which chooses the first available from controller partial, shared partial, static page and uses the correct HTTP status code.


== 0.2.11.4 2009-03-25

Changed identifier in AR::Base#concise_inspect from #id to #to_param.
Fixed raise condition for entities arg to RouteNode#for, and improved exception message.

Removed AC::Base#nestable_by declaration in favour of the new approach involving AC::Base#route_by and #nest_within, along with the corresponding reader.
Added #set_new_or_deleted_before_save controller method, and before_create and before_undestroy hooks.

Split Hammock::Callback (previously HammockCallback) out into its own file.
Split RouteNode and RouteStep (previously HammockResource and HammockRoutePiece) out into their own files.
Reject Hammock:: classes from hammock load. Classes are modules. Who knew?
Changed inheritable_attribute keys from strings to symbols.
Caching the model within HammockResource was causing stale class fails in development mode.
retrieve_record uses mdl.routing_attribute now instead of the old find_column_name.
Default routing_attribute to :id.
